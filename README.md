# ParamagicChess

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/paramagic_chess`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

This a game of chess created as the final project of TheOdinProject. The rules used are based off of Wikipedia's ruleset to
The following has been included:
* en_passant
* castling
* saving and loading. 

The game is to be played in a terminal. Tested w/ Ruby 2.5.1 on a ubuntu 18.04 / 16.04 machine.
The game also includes saving / loading as well as RSpec testing. The only dependencies are 
Bundler, RSpec, Rubocop & Rake which are all part of keeping the same environment across different development platforms but are not necessary to use this gem. They are for testing purposes only.

This gem has not been pushed to rubygems so as to not add another useless library. This was purely for educational purposes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'paramagic_chess'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

* Usage is as follows
      
      git clone https://github.com/ParamagicDev/paramagic_chess.git
      cd /path/to/paramagic_chess
      ruby lib/paramagic_chess.rb

* A prompt will pop up asking if you would like to load a previous game.
* A game can be saved at any time by typing 'save' into the terminal.
* A prompt will appear as to how you would like to save the game. 
* Games will be saved to a saved_games directory

* Pieces are moved via 'a2 to a4'
* typing 'piece_info' will show a prompt which will ask for coordinates of the piece you would like to know about
* There are other safe words which are "save", "load", "castle", "piece_info" & "exit"
* typing "castle" when its your turn will give you the option to castle right or castle left
* Pieces are only allowed to make legal moves to include en_passant, and cannot make a move which will put them in check or checkmate

## Testing
Tests can be run via navigating to paramagic_chess.rb & commenting out the ParamagicChess::Game.new.play
And then running 

    > $ rspec 
    > or 
    > $ rake spec

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

There are issues I am sure, this was more a proof of concept to show I can create a large project
Testing was minimal due to time constraints and wanting to move on to writing rails
If you would like to share or use the code feel free
